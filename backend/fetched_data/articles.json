Some students had a question about the central limit theorem–the point is that a sum of many small independent terms will be approximately normally distributed, but that won’t be the case if some of the terms have very long tails or if they have strong dependence or if there is one very large contributor to the sum. I gave as an example the distribution of heights: the distribution of heights of adult women or adult men is approximately normally distributed, but the distribution of heights of all adults is not. This is shown in the above figure from page 41 of Regression and Other Stories. But this wasn’t so clear to the students. Or, to put it another way: Some students in the class already understood the central limit theorem, and my talking through it in this way didn’t add anything to their understanding; other students in the class had only a vague conception of central limit theorem, and my explanation didn’t help.

      "content": "India’s global capability centre (GCC) story is now in a decisive new phase. What was once a real estate decision is now a well-plotted business call for many multinational companies, and flexible, managed workspaces are increasingly becoming the epicentre of that shift. The rapid evolution of GCCs is facilitated by co-working spaces, which behave less like properties and more like operating systems, offering plug-and-play facilities, infrastructure, compliance, talent access, innovation ecosystems, and allied services. This changing equation was the focus of a recent discussion at AIM on ‘How GCCs are Reshaping India’s Office Market.’ It featured Harsh Binani, Co-founder of Smartworks—one of India’s largest managed workspace platforms, and Gaurav Vasu, Founder and CEO of UnearthInsight, a leading GCC intelligence and research firm.

Residual connections made very deep networks trainable, hyper connections widened that residual stream, and training then became unstable at scale. The new method mHC, Manifold Constrained Hyper Connections, keeps the richer topology of hyper connections but locks the mixing behavior on a well defined manifold so that signals remain numerically stable in very deep stacks. https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24880 From Residual Connections To Hyper Connections Standard residual connections, as in ResNets and Transformers, propagate activations with xl+1​=xl​+F(xl​,Wl​)The identity path preserves magnitude and keeps gradients usable even when you stack many layers. Hyper Connections generalize this structure. Instead of a single residual vector of size C, the model keeps an n stream buffer 𝑥𝑙∈𝑅𝑛×𝐶.
